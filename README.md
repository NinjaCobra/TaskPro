 # TaskPro

**TaskPro** is a platform for task and project management that provides a variety of features for organizing and coordinating work. 

**Boards:** The application allows you to create boards for organizing projects or tasks. On the boards, you can create different lists, cards, and labels to order and classify tasks.

**Lists:** Within each board, you can create lists that represent stages or categories of a project. For example, you can create lists such as "In Progress," "Completed," and "Awaiting Review."

**Tasks:** In each list, you can create task cards. Cards represent individual tasks or project items that can be assigned titles, descriptions, dates, labels, attachments, and other properties.
